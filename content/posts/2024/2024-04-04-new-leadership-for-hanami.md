After 17 years dedicated to open source Ruby, Luca Guidi [has stepped down](https://discourse.hanamirb.org/t/stepping-down-from-hanami/933?u=jodosha) from the Hanami and [dry-rb](https://dry-rb.org) projects.

In Luca’s place, I will step up as Hanami project lead. I also remain a committed member of the dry-rb core team.

As for Hanami, we’re continuing on the path we’ve followed over the last few years. [2.1 is now out the door](/blog/2024/02/27/hanami-210), and 2.2 is next. As we plan for this release, you can look forward to seeing updates [on our forum](https://discourse.hanamirb.org/).

I’d like to extend a heartfelt thank you to Luca for all his contributions to Hanami and Ruby. Collaborating with Luca has been a true pleasure for me, and I’m very proud of what we’ve been able to create together in Hanami 2. I’m looking forward to extending this vision for Ruby apps in the years to come! ❤️
