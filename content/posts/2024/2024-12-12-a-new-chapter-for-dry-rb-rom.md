After 10 years working on [dry-rb](https://dry-rb.org/), and 15 years on DataMapper and now [Ruby Object Mapper](https://rom-rb.org/) (aka ROM), Peter Solnica [is retiring from the dry-rb and ROM core teams](https://solnic.dev/retiring-from-the-core-teams).

I’d like to extend my deepest thanks to Peter for all his contributions to Ruby open source software. As a co-founder of these projects, Peter has put thousands of hours into a body of work that has benefited the entire community and changed the way we think about Ruby.

Peter, my time with you has been [one of the defining chapters](https://www.icelab.com.au/notes/my-past-and-future-ruby) of my Ruby life. I’ve cherished the opportunity to work and grow alongside you. Thank you for everything! ❤️

So what’s next for dry-rb and ROM? The work continues as usual. I’m still a committed maintainer, along with fellow co-founder [Nikita Shilnikov](https://github.com/flash-gordon) as well as the Hanami team, which today numbers another six regular contributors.

But we’re not going to stop at that. We’re going to give these projects a real boost.

[We will merge dry-rb and ROM with Hanami](https://hanamirb.org/blog/2024/12/10/state-of-hanami-december-2024). One compelling toolkit for Rubyists of all stripes, now backed by a unified community and group of maintainers. This was a mutual vision of Peter’s and mine, and I am still very excited to make it happen.

Bringing these projects together will take a few months. We’ll be sharing the details as we go, so make sure to follow us [here on our blog](https://hanamirb.org/blog), or on [Mastodon](https://ruby.social/@hanami) or [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/hanamirb.org).

Our gems themselves will continue to work as always, so in the meantime you can continue to help us by using these gems in your apps, and sharing your feedback, issues and PRs. We’d love to hear from you.

Peter, thank you again for everything you’ve given us, and here’s to the next chapter for Hanami, dry-rb and ROM!
